# ARIMA
Auto Regressive Integerated Moving Average model to predict stock prices.

Time series is a series of data points indexed in time order. An ordered sequence of values of a variable at equally spaced 
intervals.
Time series data often arises when monitoring industrial processes or tracking corporate business metrics.
Time series analysis accounts for the fact that data points taken over time may have an internal structure (such as 
autocorrelation, trend or seasonal variation) and that this structure should be accounted for.

The usage of a time series model is two fold:
1. Obtain an understanding of the underlying forces and structure that produced the observed data.
2. Fit a model and forecast the required parameters. 

We are going to build an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model here to forecast future values.
Lets analyze the individual components of ARIMA:
